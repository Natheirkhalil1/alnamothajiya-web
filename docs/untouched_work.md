# Untouched Work & Future Possibilities

This document lists features that were either planned but not started, or are potential future enhancements that have not been touched yet.

## 🔮 Planned but Untouched

### 1. Advanced Text Editing
- **WYSIWYG for Rich Text:** The current `Rich Text` block uses a simple textarea. A full WYSIWYG editor (like Tiptap or Slate.js) was considered but not implemented.

### 2. Advanced Block Features
- **Block Conditions:** Ability to show/hide blocks based on rules (e.g., "Show only to logged-in users", "Show only on mobile").
- **A/B Testing:** Native support for testing two versions of a block to see which performs better.
- **Block Analytics:** Tracking interactions (clicks, views) per block.

### 3. System Enhancements
- **Accessibility Audit Tool:** A built-in tool to check pages for WCAG compliance before publishing.
- **SEO Metadata per Block:** While pages have SEO, granular SEO controls for specific blocks (like Schema.org markup generation) are untouched.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Google Docs-style editing where multiple admins can work on a page simultaneously.

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Block Marketplace:** A system to export/import blocks between different projects or share them with the community.
- **CLI Tools:** Scripts to scaffold new blocks automatically (currently manual).

## 🗑️ Deprecated / Abandoned
- **Social Feed Block:** Officially removed and abandoned due to API constraints.
